# Changelog

All notable changes to LinkBreeze will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased — v1.1.4]

### Fixed

- **Theme import card didn't state the expected file format (#44)** — The import/export card description was ambiguous about which file type to use, leaving users unsure whether to upload a zip or JSON. The system is and has always been JSON-only (export produces `.json`, import parses JSON). The card description and a new helper line under the import button now explicitly say `.json`. No behavior change — the input's `accept` attribute was already correct.
- **Type error in manifest test** — `manifest.test.ts` called `.startsWith()` on `start_url` typed as `unknown`, causing a `tsc --noEmit` failure. Added the same `as string` cast already used for `short_name` on the line above.
- **Image background overlay rendered as a dark gradient instead of a translucent tint** — `resolveBackground()` for `backgroundType: "image"` built the overlay layer as `linear-gradient(#00000080, #000000)` — alpha encoded on the first stop only, second stop dropped the alpha entirely. The result was a near-opaque dark layer over the image instead of the intended uniform translucent tint. Additionally, `overlayOpacity: "0"` still rendered the broken gradient instead of skipping the overlay. Fixed: the overlay is now a uniform translucent layer (`#color+alpha` at both gradient stops), and opacity 0 or missing skips the overlay entirely. No preset used the image background type, so no existing theme was visually affected — the bug only hit user-created image-background themes.
- **`mode` column comment claimed `auto` was supported** — The schema comment on `themes.mode` documented `dark, light, auto`, but the Zod validator, the admin UI select, and the resolver only handle `dark` and `light`. A value of `auto` would have triggered the same silent `safeParse` reject as the v1.1.2 density bug (entire save payload rejected, error swallowed client-side). Comment aligned to reality; no behavior change, no migration.
- **Click-inflation attack on `/go/:id` (security)** — The JS-free click redirect endpoint had no rate limit, while the JS fallback (`/api/track`) was throttled at 60 req/min/IP. A bot could hammer `/go/:id` in a loop to inflate any link's `clicksCount` and raw `analyticsClicks` rows indefinitely — polluting both the admin dashboard and the export. Fixed: `/go/:id` now applies the same `rateLimit("go:<ip>", 60, 60_000)` check as `/api/track`. Rate-limited requests still redirect (real users never hit the limit), but the click is not recorded. This closes the integrity gap between the two click-tracking paths.
- **"Zero client JavaScript" claim was inaccurate** — The README, CONTRIBUTING, ADR-0001, and CHANGELOG all claimed the public page ships "zero client JS", but `build-link-card.ts` emits an inline `onclick="navigator.sendBeacon(...)"` for non-http links (mailto, tel, sms). While no JS *bundle* ships (no React runtime), inline handlers are technically client-side JS. Claims softened to "zero client-side JS bundles" / "no React runtime" across all docs. The architecture is unchanged; only the marketing/technical claims were corrected to match reality.

### Added

- **Theme system regression matrix (69 tests)** — `src/lib/__tests__/theme-matrix.test.ts` locks the contract between the 4 layers that must agree: DB schema defaults, Zod validator (`customSchema`), token resolver (`resolveThemeTokens`), and the 9 preset definitions. Every past theme bug (v1.1.2 density enum, v1.1.3 `soft` shadow missing, v1.1.3 `fontScale` numeric fallthrough) was a drift between these layers that shipped to production undetected. The matrix covers 4 dimensions: (1) enum conformance — every schema default and documented enum value is a valid Zod enum member; (2) preset coverage — every preset passes Zod, produces non-default CSS vars where it declares overrides, and resolves `fontScale`/`shadowStrength` to their intended values (not the default fallthrough); (3) resolver edge cases — `resolveFontSize`, `resolveSpacing`, `resolveShadow` each handle every input shape including null/garbage without `NaN`; (4) schema↔Zod↔resolver drift guard — the full schema-default theme resolves to a complete CSS-var token set with no empty/undefined values.
- **Image overlay regression test (4 tests)** — `src/lib/__tests__/theme-image-overlay.test.ts` pins the fixed overlay render behavior across 50%/100%/0% opacity and the no-image-URL fallback path.
- **PWA manifest upgrade for public pages (closes #18)** — The manifest existed but was missing the fields browsers actually check before showing the install / "Add to Home Screen" prompt. Without `start_url` and `scope`, Android and Desktop Chrome treat the page as non-installable; without a maskable icon, Android adaptive-icon launchers letterbox the icon. Added: `start_url` (`/?source=pwa`, also lets us measure PWA launches in analytics), `scope: "/"`, `orientation: "portrait"`, `categories`, `lang`, `dir`, a maskable variant of the 192px and 512px icons, and a `screenshots` entry (Android shows this in the install sheet). `theme_color`/`background_color` kept as the existing Aurora dark navy.
- **Manifest contract test** — `src/lib/__tests__/manifest.test.ts` (6 tests) parses `public/site.webmanifest` and asserts the install-prompt-critical fields. Prevents silent regressions where someone edits the JSON and breaks installation.

### Changed

- **Extracted theme presets and Zod schema into importable modules** — `src/lib/theme-presets.ts` (the 9 presets + shared `base` defaults) and `src/lib/theme-schema.ts` (the `customSchema` Zod validator + `cssColor` helper) are now pure data modules importable by tests without dragging in the `"use server"` / `"server-only"` runtime. `src/server/queries/index.ts` and `src/server/actions/theme.ts` import from these modules instead of defining the data inline. Zero behavior change — the refactor exists to make the regression matrix possible.
- **Dependency bumps** — Merged #36 (minor-and-patch group) and #33 (vitest 3.2.6 → 4.1.10). Closed #37 (typescript 7 — blocked by `@typescript-eslint` peer range), #26 (eslint 10 — blocked by `eslint-plugin-react` incompatibility), and #22 (node 26-alpine — non-LTS, conflicting).
- **Disabled theme font preloading (perf)** — All 9 Google Fonts (21 woff2 files, 483KB) were preloaded on every page via `next/font`'s default `preload: true`, even though the public page only uses ONE font (the active theme's `fontFamily`). This was 62% of total page transfer. With `preload: false`, the `@font-face` rules remain in the CSS (so the admin theme picker still works), but the browser only downloads a font when an element actually renders with that font-family. Net effect on the public page: ~3 woff2 requests (~20KB) instead of 21 (483KB) — ~460KB saved per page view (~60% transfer reduction). No behavior change, no schema change. Admin theme picker: fonts swap in on-demand (~100ms FOUT when switching themes, no layout shift).

## [1.1.3] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **Fresh Docker deploy crash — migration 0005 fails (crash on startup)** — Migrations 0005 and 0006 were hand-written (not generated by `drizzle-kit`) and missing the `--> statement-breakpoint` markers that Drizzle's migrator uses to split statements. `better-sqlite3` only accepts one statement per `prepare()` call, so the multi-statement files threw `"You can only execute one statement at a time"`, crashing the server before it could serve a single request. Every new deployment was affected. Added the missing breakpoints. Fixes #38.
- **Preset themes ignored numeric `fontScale` values** — Presets like Editorial Paper (`"110"`), Retro Sunset (`"120"`), and others stored `fontScale` as a numeric percentage string, but `resolveFontSize()` only handled `"sm"`, `"md"`, `"lg"`. Numeric values silently fell through to the default `15px`, losing the intended font sizing. The resolver now treats numeric strings as percentages (100 = 15px, 110 = 16.5px, etc.).
- **`"Pastel Soft"` preset rendered with wrong shadow** — The theme action enum and the preset both use `shadowStrength: "soft"`, but `resolveShadow()` had no case for it — it fell through to the medium shadow. Added the missing `"soft"` case.
- **`resolveSpacing()` density values mismatched the enum** — The density enum allows `"compact"`, `"normal"`, `"relaxed"`, but the resolver checked for `"compact"`, `"spacious"`, `"comfortable"`. The `"relaxed"` value (more spacing) was dead — it fell to the default alongside `"normal"`. Fixed: `"relaxed"` now correctly returns `16px` (was `12px`), `"compact"` stays `8px`, `"normal"` stays `12px`.
- **Theme name conflicts on duplicate and import** — Duplicating a theme or importing a theme file did not check whether a theme with the same name already existed, creating silent duplicates (e.g. 5 themes all named "Aurora copy"). Both operations now reject names that are already in use with a clear error.

### Security

- **OG image and sitemap routes ignored `BASE_URL` env var** — The public page and QR route both gained `BASE_URL` support in v1.1.2 to prevent host-header injection behind reverse proxies. Two routes were missed: the OpenGraph image generator (`/[slug]/opengraph-image`) and `sitemap.xml`. Both fully trusted `x-forwarded-host`/`x-forwarded-proto`, allowing an attacker to make the instance generate OG images or sitemap URLs pointing at an attacker-controlled domain. Both now check `BASE_URL` first.
- **Password complexity requirements (setup + change password)** — Password creation only enforced `min(8)` characters with no complexity checks. A password like `aaaaaaaa` was accepted. Both setup and change-password now require at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one number. Closes #7.
- **Open-redirect hardening on `/go/:id`** — The JS-free click tracking redirect (`/go/:id`) did `NextResponse.redirect(link.url)` without a runtime protocol check. The create/update validators already block non-http schemes, but a stale or tampered DB row could bypass that. The route now validates the URL protocol at redirect time — only `http:` and `https:` are allowed.

### Changed

- **Theme export schema density default** — The `exportableThemeSchema` in backup/restore defaulted `density` to `"comfortable"` (the old invalid value that v1.1.2 migration 0006 fixed). Importing a theme file with a missing density field would create a theme with an invalid value. Default is now `"normal"`, matching the schema and Zod enum.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Themes not seeding on fresh deploy (only Aurora appears)** — `getActiveTheme()` had an inline fallback that seeded a single Aurora theme when the database was empty. Because the public page calls `getActiveTheme()` before the admin theme page is ever visited, this single Aurora prevented `seedThemesIfEmpty()` from running (it saw count > 0 and bailed). The other 8 presets never appeared. Fixed: `getActiveTheme()` now delegates to `seedThemesIfEmpty()`, making it the single source of truth. Migration 0006 also cleans up orphan fallback themes on existing broken deployments. Fixes #35.
- **Theme changes silently not saved (Zod validation failure)** — The `density` column defaulted to `"comfortable"` in the schema, but the Zod validator only accepts `"compact"`, `"normal"`, `"relaxed"`. Themes seeded by the fallback path inherited this bad value. When the user saved, the Select submitted `"comfortable"`, Zod's `safeParse` rejected the entire payload, and the error was silently swallowed by the client. Fixed: schema default changed to `"normal"`, migration 0006 repairs existing data, and the save handler now surfaces errors instead of hiding them. Fixes #35.
- **Floating promise in subscriber clear** — `clearAllSubscribers()` called the async `clearSubscribers()` without `await`, returning success before the DB delete completed and silently swallowing errors. The delete is now awaited.
- **CSV export link lint error** — The subscriber export `<a>` tag was flagged by `@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages`. Added the `download` attribute (semantically correct for file downloads — the linter recognizes `download` as an explicit non-navigation marker).
- **Unused eslint-disable in OG image route** — Removed a stale `// eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element` directive that was no longer needed (the rule doesn't trigger inside `ImageResponse`).
- **Missing lint step in CI** — The CI pipeline ran `tsc`, tests, and build but never `npm run lint`, allowing lint errors to slip into `main`. Lint now runs on every PR.

### Security

- **Forgeable admin sessions when `SECRET_KEY` unset (HIGH)** — In production, `getSecret()` silently fell back to `DEFAULT_SECRET`, a constant in the public source code. Anyone who read the repo could forge a valid admin session cookie and bypass authentication entirely. Production now throws on first use instead of degrading to a known secret. Dev mode is unaffected.
- **XFF-spoofable login brute-force protection (HIGH)** — The per-IP login rate limit (`5/min`) could be bypassed by rotating the `X-Forwarded-For` header on bare-IP deploys (the recommended Docker path). Added a global login throttle (`15/min` regardless of IP) that closes this vector for LinkBreeze's single-admin model.
- **Subscriber table-flooding DoS (HIGH)** — The public `subscribe()` endpoint had no rate limit, and `subscribers.email` had no unique constraint — the code's duplicate-catch never fired. Added a per-IP rate limit (`10/min`) and a `UNIQUE INDEX` on `email` (migration 0005). Existing duplicates are deduplicated on migrate.
- **Stored XSS via backup restore (MEDIUM)** — `restoreBackup()` validated row shapes but not link URL schemes. A shared backup file could carry `javascript:` URLs that render as clickable links on the public page, executing script in every visitor's browser. Link URLs in backups are now re-validated through `isAllowedLinkUrl()` and offending rows are dropped.
- **Host-header injection → QR phishing / OG spoofing (MEDIUM)** — Both `getOrigin()` functions (QR API + public page metadata) fully trusted `X-Forwarded-Host`/`X-Forwarded-Proto`. An attacker could make the instance generate a QR code pointing to `evil.com`, or emit `og:url`/canonical/JSON-LD pointing at an attacker domain. Added an optional `BASE_URL` env var — when set, forwarded host headers are ignored entirely.

### Changed

- **Dependency updates** — Merged 3 safe Dependabot PRs: recharts 3.9.1→3.9.2 + shadcn/ui 4.12→4.13 (minor), `@types/bcryptjs` 2.4.6→3.0.0 (dev types), `@types/node` 20.19.43→26.1.0 (dev types).
- **`next.config.ts` optimizations** — Disabled `poweredByHeader` (no longer leaks `X-Powered-By: Next.js`). Enabled `experimental.optimizePackageImports` for `lucide-react`, `recharts`, and `@dnd-kit/*` to tree-shake barrel exports and reduce client bundle size.
- **CSS-based link card hover** — Replaced inline `onmouseover`/`onmouseout` JS handlers on public-page link cards with CSS `:hover` rules using class + data attributes. This produces cleaner HTML output (2 fewer inline JS attributes per card) and enables proper `prefers-reduced-motion` gating.

### Added

- **Unique visitor count in dashboard** — The `visitorHash` was collected on every pageview since v1.0.0 but the dashboard only displayed total views (`COUNT(*)`). The Views card now shows the unique visitor count alongside total views, computed via `COUNT(DISTINCT visitorHash)`.
- **JS-free click tracking via `/go/:id` redirect** — Click tracking previously relied entirely on client-side `navigator.sendBeacon`, which fails for JS-disabled browsers, crawlers, and in-app browsers that block it. Public-page http(s) links now use `/go/:id` as their href — the server records the click (same visitor-hash logic as `/api/track`) then 302-redirects to the real URL. Non-http links (mailto, tel, etc.) still use the sendBeacon fallback. Closes #19.
- **`vCard` and `File` link types in the admin UI** — The schema and URL validator supported 8 link types, but the admin dropdown only exposed 6 (`vcard` and `file` were missing). Both are now selectable when creating or editing a link.
- **`npm run seed` script** — The demo seed script (`src/scripts/seed-demo.ts`) existed but had no `package.json` entry. Added `"seed": "tsx src/scripts/seed-demo.ts"` so developers can populate a fresh database with one command. Closes #8.
- **Skip-to-content link on public pages** — Keyboard and screen-reader users previously had to tab through the entire header before reaching link content. A visually-hidden "Skip to content" link now appears on focus, jumping directly to the main content area.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` support for link card hover** — Hover effects on public-page link cards (lift, scale, glow transforms) were applied via inline JS and ignored the user's OS-level reduced-motion preference. Hover transforms are now disabled for users who request reduced motion, matching the existing aurora-background behavior.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Fresh-deploy crash (Next.js error 1654975601)** — On a fresh `docker compose` deploy, the SQLite database was created empty with no tables because migrations never ran. The first query threw `no such table: settings`, surfacing as a generic "server error" page with code 1654975601 on every reload. Migrations now run automatically on server startup via a Next.js instrumentation hook (`src/instrumentation.ts`). The setup wizard appears on first launch as documented. Fixes #34.
- **Healthcheck false-positive** — The `/api/health` endpoint returned 200 without touching the database, so a broken instance (missing tables, corrupt DB) still reported "healthy". The health route now probes the DB with `SELECT 1` and returns 503 on failure, so the Docker healthcheck reflects real readiness.

### Changed

- **Migration files explicitly bundled** — Added `outputFileTracingIncludes` to `next.config.ts` to guarantee Drizzle migration `.sql` files and `meta/_journal.json` are included in the standalone build output (previously worked by accident; now explicit).
- **`db:migrate` script** — Added `npm run db:migrate` (`drizzle-kit migrate`) to `package.json` for manual migration in dev/CI. Docker deployments auto-migrate on boot and don't need this.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Full theme system rework** — Complete redesign of the theming engine with a CSS custom property (`--lb-*`) token system. Every visual property is now a token consumed by public page components — no hardcoded colors, radii, or shadows anywhere.
  - **9 preset themes** (was 5): Aurora (animated flagship), Glassmorphism, Neon Cyberpunk, Editorial Paper, Terminal Mono, Pastel Soft, Brutalist, Retro Sunset, Minimal Light
  - **8 background types** (was 4): solid, gradient, radial, mesh, aurora, animated gradient, image, pattern — with angle, overlay color, and overlay opacity controls
  - **6 link/card styles** (was 3): pill, rounded, sharp, glass, outline, neon
  - **10 curated Google Fonts** (was 1): Inter, Poppins, Playfair Display, JetBrains Mono, Space Grotesk, DM Sans, Lora, Bebas Neue, Sora, Outfit — loaded server-side via `next/font/google` (zero client JS, no layout shift)
  - **Full color palette**: accent, secondary, text, muted text, card background, card border — all accept hex or rgba
  - **Typography controls**: font scale (80-150%), weight (300-700), letter spacing (-2 to 5)
  - **Card controls**: button size (sm/md/lg), corner radius, border width, shadow strength (none/subtle/soft/medium/strong), hover effect (lift/scale/glow/none)
  - **Layout controls**: container width, alignment (left/center/right), density (compact/normal/relaxed)
  - **Effects**: glow toggle with custom color, glass blur, noise texture, reveal animation
  - **Theme duplication**: clone any theme (preset or custom) as a new editable copy — presets are protected from deletion
  - **Theme deletion**: custom (non-preset) themes can be deleted from the gallery
- **External analytics injection** — Paste a Plausible, Umami, Matomo, or Google Analytics `<script>` snippet into Settings; it's injected onto your public page. Self-hosters no longer need to choose between LinkBreeze's built-in analytics and their existing stack.
- **Custom CSS injection** — Raw CSS textarea in Settings, injected as a `<style>` tag on the public page. Power users can fine-tune anything the theme customizer can't reach.
- **20 new social icons** — Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, Reddit, Facebook, Pinterest, Snapchat, Patreon, Substack, Gumroad, Behance, Dribbble, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Vimeo, Signal, PayPal, Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, Medium. Total platform count: 32 (was 12).
- **Link thumbnails** — Optional image URL per link. Renders as a card with the image on top, text below — like a Discord/Slack link preview.
- **Embed widgets** — New link type `embed`. Paste a YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Vimeo, or Bandcamp URL and it renders as an inline iframe on your public page instead of a link.
- **Email capture** — Toggle in Settings adds an email signup form to the public page. Subscribers stored in SQLite, exportable to CSV from Settings. Free alternative to Linktree's $9/mo email feature.
- **Theme import/export** — Export any theme as JSON from the Theme page, import on another instance. Share presets without manual recreation. API endpoints at `/api/themes/export` and `/api/themes/import`.
- **Link scheduling UI** — The link scheduler existed in the database and query layer since v1.0.0 but had no admin UI. Added a Schedule toggle with datetime pickers (Show from / Hide after) in the link dialog, plus a "Scheduled" badge with clock icon on the links list.
- **DEV_ORIGINS env var** — For dev servers accessed via Tailscale or LAN IPs. Set `DEV_ORIGINS` in `.env` to allow Server Actions from external origins (see `.env.example`).

### Fixed

- **Atomic click tracking** — `recordClick()` now wraps the analytics insert and the `clicksCount` increment in a single `db.transaction()`. Previously these were two separate statements that could drift out of sync if the second failed, leaving the denormalized count permanently wrong.
- **JSON-LD XSS hardening** — The structured data `<script>` tag now escapes `<` characters (`\u003c`) in the `JSON.stringify` output, preventing profile text fields (displayName, bio) from breaking out of the script context.
- **Embed widget rendering** — Spotify embeds now use a fixed 152px height (matching Spotify's native player) instead of a bloated 16:9 aspect ratio container that left empty space. YouTube embeds use `youtube-nocookie.com` with `rel=0` and `modestbranding=1` for a cleaner, privacy-respecting player. Redundant title captions removed for YouTube/Spotify (they show their own title). Fixed Spotify double `/embed/` path bug that caused 404s.
- **Link thumbnail layout** — Cards with thumbnail images now use block layout (image on top, content row below) instead of `flex-wrap`, which was shrinking the image and crushing the title text between the image and the card's right border.

### Changed

- **Schema expanded** — Themes table rebuilt with ~25 new columns. Migration `0004_theme-rework.sql` handles the upgrade safely (copies existing data, new columns get sensible defaults). Old themes continue to work.
- **Token resolver** — New `src/lib/theme-tokens.ts` (466 lines) provides `resolveThemeTokens()` → CSS vars + keyframes, `buildThemeStyleBlock()`, `resolveBackground()` (handles all 8 types), `resolveFont()`, and animated background detection.
- **Public components refactored** — `build-link-card.ts`, `LinkCard.tsx`, `ProfileHeader.tsx`, `SocialIcons.tsx`, `EmailCapture.tsx`, and `page.tsx` now consume `var(--lb-*)` tokens instead of hardcoded values.
- **Customizer UI overhauled** — `theme-manager.tsx` rebuilt with 6 organized sections (Background, Colors, Typography, Card Style, Layout, Effects). Includes color pickers, font radio picker with previews, sliders, toggles, and selects for all enum fields.
- **Server actions expanded** — `customizeActiveTheme` now accepts all new fields with Zod validation. New `duplicateActiveTheme` and `deleteCustomTheme` actions added.
- **Export/import updated** — Theme JSON now carries all new fields. Backward compatible with old exports.
- **Seed demo** — Now seeds the Aurora preset instead of the old 5-theme set.
- **Removed dead `metadata` column** — The `links.metadata` column (default `"{}"`) was defined in the schema but never read or written anywhere in the codebase. Removed from the schema, backup Zod validation, and a new migration (`0001_remove_link_metadata.sql`) drops it from existing databases.
- **allowedDevOrigins via env** — `next.config.ts` now reads `DEV_ORIGINS` from the environment instead of hardcoding IPs. Safe to commit — no private IPs in the repo.
- **README features + comparison** — Features list expanded from 8 to 14 items. Comparison table expanded from 12 to 17 rows, now includes External Analytics, Email Capture, Embed Widgets, Link Thumbnails, Custom CSS, and Themes Import/Export.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Updated theme submission instructions to reference the new dedicated theme export feature and full token-based theme properties table.
- **Migrations** — Four new migrations: `0001_remove_link_metadata`, `0002_add_image_url_to_links`, `0003_add_subscribers_table`, `0004_theme-rework`. All run automatically on next startup.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `actions/checkout` from v4 to v7 (#21)
- Bumped `actions/setup-node` from v4 to v6 (#20)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-04

### Security

- **SVG upload XSS eliminated** — Removed `.svg` from the upload allowlist entirely. Added `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers to the uploads serving route as defense-in-depth. Closes #15.
- **Login rate limiting** — The login form is now rate-limited to 5 attempts/min per IP, preventing brute-force password attacks. Closes #1.
- **Production secret key warning** — When `SECRET_KEY` is unset in production, both `session-token.ts` and `visitor.ts` now log a loud console warning. The `/api/health` endpoint exposes `secretKeySet: boolean` so monitoring tools can detect misconfiguration. Closes #9.
- **Backup row validation** — `restoreBackup()` now validates every row (profiles, links, settings, themes) with Zod schemas before the database transaction. Malformed backup files are rejected instead of corrupting the DB.
- **Analytics foreign key** — `analytics_clicks.link_id` now has a foreign key reference to `links.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. `deleteLink()` also explicitly cleans up orphaned analytics rows for databases created before this constraint existed.

### Added

- **Comprehensive test suite** — 134 tests across 16 files covering pure functions, server actions, and security validation. Includes tests for: rate limiting, visitor hashing, device detection, geo/country lookup, QR code generation, session tokens, social icon detection/normalization, link URL scheme validation, demo mode guards, upload content types, version reading, theme backgrounds, link card rendering, auth (login + setup), settings updates, link CRUD, and backup validation. (Closes #6, #17)

### Fixed

- **Login sidebar bug** — When already logged in, visiting `/login` showed the login form inside the admin sidebar layout. Now `/login` is a server component that redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`. The page split into `page.tsx` (server, session check) + `login-form.tsx` (client, interactive form).
- **Health endpoint version** — `/api/health` now reads the version dynamically from `package.json` instead of returning a hardcoded `1.0.0`.
- **Backup version constant** — `exportBackup()` now uses `SUPPORTED_BACKUP_VERSION` instead of a hardcoded `1` literal.

### Changed

- **Atomic transactions** — `reorderLinks()`, `clearAnalytics()`, and `setActiveTheme()` now wrap their multi-statement operations in `db.transaction()`. Crashes mid-operation no longer leave the database in an inconsistent state.
- **Proactive rate-limit cleanup** — The rate-limit bucket map now sweeps expired entries every 30 seconds (when map exceeds 100 entries) instead of only on overflow at 10,000 keys. Prevents slow memory growth under sustained traffic.
- **Shared analytics-range module** — Extracted duplicated `sinceExpr`/`parseRange` logic from `queries/index.ts` and `api/analytics/export/route.ts` into `src/lib/analytics-range.ts`. Single source of truth for range types and SQL window expressions.
- **Code cleanup** — Moved `updateUserPassword` from server actions to queries layer. Removed unused `inArray` import and dead `void inArray` statement. Documented `getActiveProfile` as an intentional extension point.
- **Dependency overrides** — Added npm overrides for `postcss >= 8.5.10` and `esbuild >= 0.25.0`. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities (was 6 moderate).
- **Proxy documentation** — Documented the defense-in-depth session validation split: middleware checks signature + expiry (fast first gate), `getSession()` checks password version (authoritative second gate).
- **CI workflow** — Now runs `npm run test` (Vitest) in addition to tsc + build. Closes #2.
- **Docker release workflow** — Added `.github/workflows/release.yml` that builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR automatically on tag push (`v*`). Tags both `latest` and the version number.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-03

### Security

- **Session invalidation on password change** — Changing your password now invalidates all existing sessions (stolen or old cookies become instantly invalid). Implemented via a `sessionVersion` counter in the settings table: tokens include the version at issue time, `getSession()` rejects mismatches.
- **QR download endpoint rate limiting** — The `/api/qr` endpoint is now rate-limited to 30 requests/min per IP. Prevents CPU abuse from repeated QR generation.
- **CSRF protection documented** — SECURITY.md now documents that Next.js 16 Server Actions verify `Origin`/`Host` headers on every non-GET submission (built-in framework protection, no manual token needed).
- **SECURITY.md vulnerability reporting** — Added response timeline (48h ack, 7-day status, 30/90-day patch targets) and safe harbor clause for security researchers.
- **Social icon URL detection hardened** — Platform detection in `social-icons.ts` now uses proper hostname matching (`isHost()`) instead of `.includes()`. Prevents `evil.com/github.com` from matching as GitHub. Resolves 11 CodeQL alerts.
- **CI workflow permissions** — Added explicit `permissions: contents: read` to CI workflow. Follows least-privilege principle. Resolves 1 CodeQL alert.
- **Link URL scheme validation** — Link URLs are now validated by type: only `http:`/`https:` for regular links, `mailto:` for email, `tel:` for phone, `wa.me` for WhatsApp, etc. Blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URI XSS. (Contributed by @MFA-G, PR #29, closes #14)
- **Backup version validation** — Restoring a backup from an incompatible future version is now rejected before any database transaction runs. (Contributed by @vku2018, PR #30, closes #16)

### Added

- **robots.txt** — Dynamic route that blocks admin and API routes, allows the public slug page.
- **sitemap.xml** — Dynamic route that reads the public slug from the database and derives the origin from request headers.
- **LICENSE** — MIT license file (was referenced in README but missing from repo).
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — Dedicated troubleshooting guide: Docker Desktop issues, PowerShell syntax errors, password recovery (3 methods), port conflicts, database corruption, analytics tracking, cache issues.
- **Upgrade guide** — TROUBLESHOOTING.md now documents the upgrade process (Docker pull + auto-migrations, non-Docker steps).
- **Slug management docs** — TROUBLESHOOTING.md now explains how slug changes work (no redirects, reserved words, QR code behavior).
- **Accessibility docs** — SECURITY.md now documents the accessibility posture (Radix/shadcn WAI-ARIA, keyboard nav, WCAG AA contrast, screen-reader support).
- **GitHub Discussions** — Enabled on the repository.

### Fixed

- **Middleware session validation** — Middleware now verifies the HMAC signature and expiry of the `lb_session` cookie instead of only checking for its existence. Forged or expired cookies are redirected to `/login`. Token logic extracted into `src/lib/session-token.ts` (shared between `proxy.ts` and `auth.ts`).
- **README Docker commands** — Fixed PowerShell compatibility: `docker run` command now works on Windows (backslash continuation broke PowerShell). Added single-line variant.
- **docker-compose.yml** — Now pulls pre-built image from GHCR by default instead of building from source.
- **SECURITY.md** — Corrected 4 false claims: session expiry is 30 days (not 7), X-Frame-Options is `SAMEORIGIN` (not `DENY`), removed non-existent login rate-limiting claim, removed false Docker read-only filesystem claim. Added honest "Known Limitations" section.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Removed references to non-existent `public/themes/` directory (themes are DB-stored, managed via admin panel). Added test step to PR checklist.
- **package.json** — Version aligned with release: `0.1.0` → `1.0.0`.
- **Theme submission template** — Updated to reflect actual admin-panel-based theme workflow.

### Changed

- **README.md** — Split docker-compose instructions into Option A (pre-built image) and Option B (build from source). Added "Make sure Docker is running" note. Added CHANGELOG and TROUBLESHOOTING links to documentation section. Added CI badge.
- **PR template** — Now requires `npm run test` to pass.
- **Dependencies** — Bumped via Dependabot: next 16.2.9→16.2.10, react 19.2.4→19.2.7, react-dom 19.2.4→19.2.7, lucide-react 1.22→1.23, recharts 3.9.0→3.9.1, tailwindcss 4.3.1→4.3.2, eslint-config-next 16.2.9→16.2.10.
- **Dependabot** — Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated weekly npm/Docker and monthly GitHub Actions updates.

### Removed

- **47 MB of unused screenshots** — Deleted uncompressed PNG variants that were never referenced by the README.

### Social

- **GitHub social preview** — Uploaded 1280x640 banner image for link unfurls on Reddit, Twitter, Discord.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Link management** — Add, reorder, toggle, and customize unlimited links with drag-and-drop (dnd-kit)
- **Privacy-first analytics** — Page views, click tracking, referrers, device type, country detection. No cookies, no raw IP storage (SHA-256 with daily-rotating salt)
- **5 built-in themes** — Midnight, Sunset, Ocean, Mono, Forest presets
- **Full theme customizer** — Colors, fonts, backgrounds (solid/gradient/pattern), link styles (rounded/sharp/glass), animations (lift/scale/none)
- **QR codes** — Auto-generated for public pages, downloadable as SVG or PNG
- **Link scheduling** — Schedule links to appear/disappear automatically
- **Admin dashboard** — Overview stats, views chart with date range picker, per-link click analytics
- **Profile editor** — Avatar upload, display name, bio, badge text, social links
- **Setup wizard** — First-run setup creates the admin account in under 30 seconds
- **Settings page** — Page slug, SEO title/description, footer text, password change
- **Backup system** — Export/import full configuration (profile, links, settings, themes) as JSON. Transactional restore with rollback.
- **Analytics export** — CSV export of pageview and click data
- **Analytics retention setting** — Configurable retention window
- **Security headers** — HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **CSP on SVG images** — Strips scripts/sandbox from served SVG to neutralize XSS
- **Health endpoint** — `/api/health` for Docker HEALTHCHECK and load balancer probes
- **OpenGraph images** — Auto-generated OG images per public page for social sharing
- **JSON-LD structured data** — ProfilePage schema for SEO
- **Docker image** — Multi-stage build, non-root user, HEALTHCHECK directive. Published to `ghcr.io/manak-hash/linkbreeze:latest`
- **CI pipeline** — TypeScript type-check + Next.js build on every PR
- **Issue templates** — Bug report, feature request, theme submission
- **4 ADR documents** — Technology decisions documented (Next.js, Drizzle, SQLite, abstraction layer)

### Security

- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- HMAC-signed session cookies with constant-time comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`)
- httpOnly, SameSite cookie attributes
- Zod input validation on every server action and API route boundary
- Path-traversal-safe file upload resolution
- File upload restrictions: images only, 2 MB max, sanitized random filenames
- Rate limiting on analytics tracking endpoint (60 req/min per IP)

### Technical

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Components, ISR)
- **Database**: SQLite via better-sqlite3 (WAL mode)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (type-safe, zero-overhead)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Public page**: No client-side JS bundles (no React runtime) — pure Server Components. http/https links use a JS-free `/go/:id` redirect for click tracking; mailto/tel links use a tiny inline `onclick` sendBeacon beacon.
- **Performance**: <300ms FCP target, ISR with 60s revalidation
