and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Full theme system rework** — Complete redesign of the theming engine with a CSS custom property (`--lb-*`) token system. Every visual property is now a token consumed by public page components — no hardcoded colors, radii, or shadows anywhere.
  - **9 preset themes** (was 5): Aurora (animated flagship), Glassmorphism, Neon Cyberpunk, Editorial Paper, Terminal Mono, Pastel Soft, Brutalist, Retro Sunset, Minimal Light
  - **8 background types** (was 4): solid, gradient, radial, mesh, aurora, animated gradient, image, pattern — with angle, overlay color, and overlay opacity controls
  - **6 link/card styles** (was 3): pill, rounded, sharp, glass, outline, neon
  - **10 curated Google Fonts** (was 1): Inter, Poppins, Playfair Display, JetBrains Mono, Space Grotesk, DM Sans, Lora, Bebas Neue, Sora, Outfit — loaded server-side via `next/font/google` (zero client JS, no layout shift)
  - **Full color palette**: accent, secondary, text, muted text, card background, card border — all accept hex or rgba
  - **Typography controls**: font scale (80-150%), weight (300-700), letter spacing (-2 to 5)
  - **Card controls**: button size (sm/md/lg), corner radius, border width, shadow strength (none/subtle/soft/medium/strong), hover effect (lift/scale/glow/none)
  - **Layout controls**: container width, alignment (left/center/right), density (compact/normal/relaxed)
  - **Effects**: glow toggle with custom color, glass blur, noise texture, reveal animation
  - **Theme duplication**: clone any theme (preset or custom) as a new editable copy — presets are protected from deletion
  - **Theme deletion**: custom (non-preset) themes can be deleted from the gallery
- **External analytics injection** — Paste a Plausible, Umami, Matomo, or Google Analytics `<script>` snippet into Settings; it's injected onto your public page. Self-hosters no longer need to choose between LinkBreeze's built-in analytics and their existing stack.
- **Custom CSS injection** — Raw CSS textarea in Settings, injected as a `<style>` tag on the public page. Power users can fine-tune anything the theme customizer can't reach.
- **20 new social icons** — Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, Reddit, Facebook, Pinterest, Snapchat, Patreon, Substack, Gumroad, Behance, Dribbble, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Vimeo, Signal, PayPal, Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, Medium. Total platform count: 32 (was 12).
- **Link thumbnails** — Optional image URL per link. Renders as a card with the image on top, text below — like a Discord/Slack link preview.
- **Embed widgets** — New link type `embed`. Paste a YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Vimeo, or Bandcamp URL and it renders as an inline iframe on your public page instead of a link.
- **Email capture** — Toggle in Settings adds an email signup form to the public page. Subscribers stored in SQLite, exportable to CSV from Settings. Free alternative to Linktree's $9/mo email feature.
- **Theme import/export** — Export any theme as JSON from the Theme page, import on another instance. Share presets without manual recreation. API endpoints at `/api/themes/export` and `/api/themes/import`.
- **Link scheduling UI** — The link scheduler existed in the database and query layer since v1.0.0 but had no admin UI. Added a Schedule toggle with datetime pickers (Show from / Hide after) in the link dialog, plus a "Scheduled" badge with clock icon on the links list.
- **DEV_ORIGINS env var** — For dev servers accessed via Tailscale or LAN IPs. Set `DEV_ORIGINS` in `.env` to allow Server Actions from external origins (see `.env.example`).

### Fixed

- **Atomic click tracking** — `recordClick()` now wraps the analytics insert and the `clicksCount` increment in a single `db.transaction()`. Previously these were two separate statements that could drift out of sync if the second failed, leaving the denormalized count permanently wrong.
- **JSON-LD XSS hardening** — The structured data `<script>` tag now escapes `<` characters (`\u003c`) in the `JSON.stringify` output, preventing profile text fields (displayName, bio) from breaking out of the script context.
- **Embed widget rendering** — Spotify embeds now use a fixed 152px height (matching Spotify's native player) instead of a bloated 16:9 aspect ratio container that left empty space. YouTube embeds use `youtube-nocookie.com` with `rel=0` and `modestbranding=1` for a cleaner, privacy-respecting player. Redundant title captions removed for YouTube/Spotify (they show their own title). Fixed Spotify double `/embed/` path bug that caused 404s.
- **Link thumbnail layout** — Cards with thumbnail images now use block layout (image on top, content row below) instead of `flex-wrap`, which was shrinking the image and crushing the title text between the image and the card's right border.

### Changed

- **Schema expanded** — Themes table rebuilt with ~25 new columns. Migration `0004_theme-rework.sql` handles the upgrade safely (copies existing data, new columns get sensible defaults). Old themes continue to work.
- **Token resolver** — New `src/lib/theme-tokens.ts` (466 lines) provides `resolveThemeTokens()` → CSS vars + keyframes, `buildThemeStyleBlock()`, `resolveBackground()` (handles all 8 types), `resolveFont()`, and animated background detection.
- **Public components refactored** — `build-link-card.ts`, `LinkCard.tsx`, `ProfileHeader.tsx`, `SocialIcons.tsx`, `EmailCapture.tsx`, and `page.tsx` now consume `var(--lb-*)` tokens instead of hardcoded values.
- **Customizer UI overhauled** — `theme-manager.tsx` rebuilt with 6 organized sections (Background, Colors, Typography, Card Style, Layout, Effects). Includes color pickers, font radio picker with previews, sliders, toggles, and selects for all enum fields.
- **Server actions expanded** — `customizeActiveTheme` now accepts all new fields with Zod validation. New `duplicateActiveTheme` and `deleteCustomTheme` actions added.
- **Export/import updated** — Theme JSON now carries all new fields. Backward compatible with old exports.
- **Seed demo** — Now seeds the Aurora preset instead of the old 5-theme set.
- **Removed dead `metadata` column** — The `links.metadata` column (default `"{}"`) was defined in the schema but never read or written anywhere in the codebase. Removed from the schema, backup Zod validation, and a new migration (`0001_remove_link_metadata.sql`) drops it from existing databases.
- **allowedDevOrigins via env** — `next.config.ts` now reads `DEV_ORIGINS` from the environment instead of hardcoding IPs. Safe to commit — no private IPs in the repo.
- **README features + comparison** — Features list expanded from 8 to 14 items. Comparison table expanded from 12 to 17 rows, now includes External Analytics, Email Capture, Embed Widgets, Link Thumbnails, Custom CSS, and Themes Import/Export.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Updated theme submission instructions to reference the new dedicated theme export feature and full token-based theme properties table.
- **Migrations** — Four new migrations: `0001_remove_link_metadata`, `0002_add_image_url_to_links`, `0003_add_subscribers_table`, `0004_theme-rework`. All run automatically on next startup.

### Dependencies

- Bumped `actions/checkout` from v4 to v7 (#21)
- Bumped `actions/setup-node` from v4 to v6 (#20)

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-04

### Security

- **SVG upload XSS eliminated** — Removed `.svg` from the upload allowlist entirely. Added `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers to the uploads serving route as defense-in-depth. Closes #15.
- **Login rate limiting** — The login form is now rate-limited to 5 attempts/min per IP, preventing brute-force password attacks. Closes #1.
- **Production secret key warning** — When `SECRET_KEY` is unset in production, both `session-token.ts` and `visitor.ts` now log a loud console warning. The `/api/health` endpoint exposes `secretKeySet: boolean` so monitoring tools can detect misconfiguration. Closes #9.
- **Backup row validation** — `restoreBackup()` now validates every row (profiles, links, settings, themes) with Zod schemas before the database transaction. Malformed backup files are rejected instead of corrupting the DB.
- **Analytics foreign key** — `analytics_clicks.link_id` now has a foreign key reference to `links.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. `deleteLink()` also explicitly cleans up orphaned analytics rows for databases created before this constraint existed.

### Added

- **Comprehensive test suite** — 134 tests across 16 files covering pure functions, server actions, and security validation. Includes tests for: rate limiting, visitor hashing, device detection, geo/country lookup, QR code generation, session tokens, social icon detection/normalization, link URL scheme validation, demo mode guards, upload content types, version reading, theme backgrounds, link card rendering, auth (login + setup), settings updates, link CRUD, and backup validation. (Closes #6, #17)

### Fixed

- **Login sidebar bug** — When already logged in, visiting `/login` showed the login form inside the admin sidebar layout. Now `/login` is a server component that redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`. The page split into `page.tsx` (server, session check) + `login-form.tsx` (client, interactive form).
- **Health endpoint version** — `/api/health` now reads the version dynamically from `package.json` instead of returning a hardcoded `1.0.0`.
- **Backup version constant** — `exportBackup()` now uses `SUPPORTED_BACKUP_VERSION` instead of a hardcoded `1` literal.

### Changed

- **Atomic transactions** — `reorderLinks()`, `clearAnalytics()`, and `setActiveTheme()` now wrap their multi-statement operations in `db.transaction()`. Crashes mid-operation no longer leave the database in an inconsistent state.
- **Proactive rate-limit cleanup** — The rate-limit bucket map now sweeps expired entries every 30 seconds (when map exceeds 100 entries) instead of only on overflow at 10,000 keys. Prevents slow memory growth under sustained traffic.
- **Shared analytics-range module** — Extracted duplicated `sinceExpr`/`parseRange` logic from `queries/index.ts` and `api/analytics/export/route.ts` into `src/lib/analytics-range.ts`. Single source of truth for range types and SQL window expressions.
- **Code cleanup** — Moved `updateUserPassword` from server actions to queries layer. Removed unused `inArray` import and dead `void inArray` statement. Documented `getActiveProfile` as an intentional extension point.
- **Dependency overrides** — Added npm overrides for `postcss >= 8.5.10` and `esbuild >= 0.25.0`. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities (was 6 moderate).
- **Proxy documentation** — Documented the defense-in-depth session validation split: middleware checks signature + expiry (fast first gate), `getSession()` checks password version (authoritative second gate).
- **CI workflow** — Now runs `npm run test` (Vitest) in addition to tsc + build. Closes #2.
- **Docker release workflow** — Added `.github/workflows/release.yml` that builds and pushes Docker images to GHCR automatically on tag push (`v*`). Tags both `latest` and the version number.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-03

### Security

- **Session invalidation on password change** — Changing your password now invalidates all existing sessions (stolen or old cookies become instantly invalid). Implemented via a `sessionVersion` counter in the settings table: tokens include the version at issue time, `getSession()` rejects mismatches.
- **QR download endpoint rate limiting** — The `/api/qr` endpoint is now rate-limited to 30 requests/min per IP. Prevents CPU abuse from repeated QR generation.
- **CSRF protection documented** — SECURITY.md now documents that Next.js 16 Server Actions verify `Origin`/`Host` headers on every non-GET submission (built-in framework protection, no manual token needed).
- **SECURITY.md vulnerability reporting** — Added response timeline (48h ack, 7-day status, 30/90-day patch targets) and safe harbor clause for security researchers.
- **Social icon URL detection hardened** — Platform detection in `social-icons.ts` now uses proper hostname matching (`isHost()`) instead of `.includes()`. Prevents `evil.com/github.com` from matching as GitHub. Resolves 11 CodeQL alerts.
- **CI workflow permissions** — Added explicit `permissions: contents: read` to CI workflow. Follows least-privilege principle. Resolves 1 CodeQL alert.
- **Link URL scheme validation** — Link URLs are now validated by type: only `http:`/`https:` for regular links, `mailto:` for email, `tel:` for phone, `wa.me` for WhatsApp, etc. Blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URI XSS. (Contributed by @MFA-G, PR #29, closes #14)
- **Backup version validation** — Restoring a backup from an incompatible future version is now rejected before any database transaction runs. (Contributed by @vku2018, PR #30, closes #16)

### Added

- **robots.txt** — Dynamic route that blocks admin and API routes, allows the public slug page.
- **sitemap.xml** — Dynamic route that reads the public slug from the database and derives the origin from request headers.
- **LICENSE** — MIT license file (was referenced in README but missing from repo).
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — Dedicated troubleshooting guide: Docker Desktop issues, PowerShell syntax errors, password recovery (3 methods), port conflicts, database corruption, analytics tracking, cache issues.
- **Upgrade guide** — TROUBLESHOOTING.md now documents the upgrade process (Docker pull + auto-migrations, non-Docker steps).
- **Slug management docs** — TROUBLESHOOTING.md now explains how slug changes work (no redirects, reserved words, QR code behavior).
- **Accessibility docs** — SECURITY.md now documents the accessibility posture (Radix/shadcn WAI-ARIA, keyboard nav, WCAG AA contrast, screen-reader support).
- **GitHub Discussions** — Enabled on the repository.

### Fixed

- **Middleware session validation** — Middleware now verifies the HMAC signature and expiry of the `lb_session` cookie instead of only checking for its existence. Forged or expired cookies are redirected to `/login`. Token logic extracted into `src/lib/session-token.ts` (shared between `proxy.ts` and `auth.ts`).
- **README Docker commands** — Fixed PowerShell compatibility: `docker run` command now works on Windows (backslash continuation broke PowerShell). Added single-line variant.
- **docker-compose.yml** — Now pulls pre-built image from GHCR by default instead of building from source.
- **SECURITY.md** — Corrected 4 false claims: session expiry is 30 days (not 7), X-Frame-Options is `SAMEORIGIN` (not `DENY`), removed non-existent login rate-limiting claim, removed false Docker read-only filesystem claim. Added honest "Known Limitations" section.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Removed references to non-existent `public/themes/` directory (themes are DB-stored, managed via admin panel). Added test step to PR checklist.
- **package.json** — Version aligned with release: `0.1.0` → `1.0.0`.
- **Theme submission template** — Updated to reflect actual admin-panel-based theme workflow.

### Changed

- **README.md** — Split docker-compose instructions into Option A (pre-built image) and Option B (build from source). Added "Make sure Docker is running" note. Added CHANGELOG and TROUBLESHOOTING links to documentation section. Added CI badge.
- **PR template** — Now requires `npm run test` to pass.
- **Dependencies** — Bumped via Dependabot: next 16.2.9→16.2.10, react 19.2.4→19.2.7, react-dom 19.2.4→19.2.7, lucide-react 1.22→1.23, recharts 3.9.0→3.9.1, tailwindcss 4.3.1→4.3.2, eslint-config-next 16.2.9→16.2.10.
- **Dependabot** — Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated weekly npm/Docker and monthly GitHub Actions updates.

### Removed

- **47 MB of unused screenshots** — Deleted uncompressed PNG variants that were never referenced by the README.

### Social

- **GitHub social preview** — Uploaded 1280x640 banner image for link unfurls on Reddit, Twitter, Discord.
