/**
 * Next.js Instrumentation — runs ONCE when the server boots, before any
 * request is served. Used to auto-run database migrations so that a fresh
 * deploy (empty SQLite volume) has its tables created before the first query
 * lands.
 *
 * Fixes the "no such table" crash (Next.js error code 1654975601) on fresh
 * `docker compose` deploys where no migration step was wired into the image.
 *
 * Drizzle's migrate() is journaled in __drizzle_migrations, so this is a safe
 * no-op on databases that are already up to date (existing installs, demo).
